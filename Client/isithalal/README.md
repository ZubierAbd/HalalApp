### About

This app is the front end for a fullstack application that I am building using Material UI. Is it Halal will work as a onestop place for users to know if a restaurant is Halal or not. I have built a small webscrapping utility which scrapes the halal certification authorities of Canada to seed the database, which in turn, is connected to the front end.

### MVP of product

Front end site will have a search bar which will make a request to the backend and find the name of the restaurant. If the name is there, it will return the answer and say if the restaurant is halal or not.
